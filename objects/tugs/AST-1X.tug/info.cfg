# SCHOPF GOLDHOFER AST-1X 680 tug config file

# You can use '%'-style escape sequences in filenames to incorporate
# things such as spaces. For example "foo bar.wav" should written as
# "foo%20bar.wav" (without the quotes, obviously). You can use directory
# nesting (e.g. "foo/bar.wav"), but in that case always use '/' as a
# directory separator not the Windows convention of using '\'.
